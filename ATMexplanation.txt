KEEPSAFE Bank ATM machine 

In this code I have built diffrent mechanism of Card Read, PIN verification, Overdrawing balance using Switch Case function
In 1st case Card read have some array value limit of 12 digits.
In 2nd case PIN verification array value limit has 4 digits which is pre declared value(PIN).
In 3rd case Withdraw Overdrawing means when a person wants to withdraw an amount but not enough Account balance then overdraw takes place with fixed 
extra amount to withdraw.

HOPE YOU LIKE my code logic looking forward with you
Thankyou ;)
